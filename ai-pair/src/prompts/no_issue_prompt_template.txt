Improve the following Java / gradle project:

Here are the current contents of the Java files:
{filesContent}

Here is the build file contents:
{buildGradleContent}

Please provide the updated code for the files that will make the test pass. Only include 
files that require changes in the response. Before each file path, add the following:
File: <file_path>

Do not EVER change any of the unit test classes (*.Test.java).

The results will be used to save a file to code so do NOT use markdown formatting or 
include other information in the response. Only the files and their contents.
